This Mapbox GL JS module is unmaintained; it's excess baggage from an upstream monorepo. Please see [@watergis/maplibre-gl-export](@watergis/maplibre-gl-export
) if you need something like this.

Active development here is for MapLibre GL JS and that source is at [maplibre-gl-export](https://github.com/erictheise/maplibre-gl-export).
